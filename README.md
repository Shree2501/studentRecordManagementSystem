# 📁 Student Record Management System (Python)

A simple file-based Student Record Management System built using Python to demonstrate file handling concepts, including different file modes and basic CRUD operations.
This project does not use a database. All data is stored and managed using text files, making it ideal for understanding core file operations in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new student records
- View all stored student records
-Update existing student details
-Persistent storage using text files
-Menu-driven console interface

## 🛠 Technologies Used

-Python 3
-File Handling (open())
-Text files (.txt)

## ✏ Update Function Behavior

-Update student name and/or marks
-Leave input empty to keep existing values
-Ensures data integrity by rewriting the file safely

## ❗ Limitations

-No delete record feature
-No input validation for marks
-Uses plain text instead of structured formats (CSV/DB)

## 🔮 Future Improvements

-Delete student records
-Input validation
-CSV-based storage
-Binary file handling using pickle
-Object-Oriented version of the system

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This project is designed for:
-B-eginners learning Python file handling
-College mini-projects
-Practical understanding of file modes and persistence
